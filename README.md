## 🏆 Day 9 Silent Auction Program (Python)

This project is a **Silent Auction** program written in Python.
It allows multiple users to place bids anonymously and automatically determines the highest bidder at the end of the auction.

This project is part of **Day 9 – Silent Auction** from  
Udemy – 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Angela Yu.


## 📌 Features

- Accepts multiple bidders
- Stores bids using a Python dictionary
- Clears the screen between bidders for privacy
- Uses a function to determine the highest bid
- Displays the auction winner and winning bid


## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program displays an auction logo 🎨
2. Users enter their name and bid amount 💰
3. Each bid is stored in a dictionary as `{name: bid}`
4. The program asks if there are other bidders ❓
5. The screen is cleared if bidding continues 🧹
6. When bidding ends, the program calculates and prints the winner 🏆

## ▶️ Example Output

Enter your name: Alice  
Enter your bid: 150  
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no': yes  

Enter your name: Bob  
Enter your bid: 200  
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no': no  

The winner is Bob with a bid of 200
